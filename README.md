# SupercellAnimateExporter
A tool to export ONE export name from SupercellSWF platform (Good for low-end PCs)

This tool currently has bugs and is open for pull requests.

Everything was working fine until I wanted to optimize the resources (as I was copying all of them) and I just checked shapes then based on them get the resources.

Tool is almost working. Thanks to Daniil SV without him I would probably not succeed.

Tool made in one day... so the code is shit
